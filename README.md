This is a 42 school project.
The objective was to get familiar with the concept of ray tracing and creating scenes using it. Our ray tracing program uses four different objects to create its scenes.
(Plane, sphere, cylinder and cone). The program reads the "scene" from a file and creates the 3D images with "realistic" shadows and reflections.

Example of the scene file:

![scene eval09 file:](https://github.com/Makenfile86/rtv1/blob/main/scene_09.png?raw=true)

Each object has its coordinates, size, color and position according to possible rotation values. Also there are also the camera and spot(s) values that determine the position of the camera or the "eye" and spots that are the light sources with their own position and light power.

Out of the example scene comes this image:

![scene eval09 image:](https://github.com/Makenfile86/rtv1/blob/main/palace.png?raw=true)

From other camera angles:

![scene eval09 image2:](https://github.com/Makenfile86/rtv1/blob/main/palace2.png?raw=true)

![scene eval09 image3:](https://github.com/Makenfile86/rtv1/blob/main/palace3.png?raw=true)
