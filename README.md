This is a 42 school project.
The objective was to get familiar with the concept of ray tracing and creating scenes using it. Our ray tracing program uses four different objects to create its scenes.
(Plane, sphere, cylinder and cone). The program reads the "scene" from a file creates the 3D image using minilibx library.

Example of the scene file:

![scene eval09 file:](https://github.com/Makenfile86/fractol/blob/main/moving_julia.png?raw=true)
